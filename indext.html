<h1>padma bridge</h1>
<p>
The Padma Multipurpose Bridge (Bengali: পদ্মা বহুমুখী সেতু, romanized: Pôdma Bôhumukhī Setu), commonly known as the Padma Bridge (Bengali: পদ্মা সেতু, romanized: Pôdma Setu), is a two-level road-rail bridge across the Padma River, the main distributary of the Ganges in Bangladesh.[5][6] It connects Louhajang Upazila of Munshiganj and Zazira Upazila of Shariatpur and a small part of Shibchar Upazila of Madaripur, linking the less developed southwest of the country to the northern and eastern regions. The bridge was inaugurated at morning on 25 June 2022 with white pigeon by the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.[3]

The bridge is considered to be the most challenging construction project in the history of Bangladesh, the steel truss bridge carries a four-lane highway on the upper level[7] and a single track railway on the lower level.[8] The bridge consists of 41 sections, each 150.12 m (492.5 ft) long and 22 metres (72 ft) wide, with a total length of 6.15 km (3.82 mi).[6] It is the longest bridge in Bangladesh,[7] the longest bridge over the river Ganges (Gaṅgā) by both span and total length, and features the highest pile depth of any bridge in the world at 120 m (390 ft).[9][10] It is the deepest bridge in the world, with piles installed as deep as 127 metres.[11] The construction of the bridge was considered to be especially challenging due to width and depth of the Padma River.
